Welcome to my website. I am Kaleel Mahmood, an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science and Statistics](https://web.uri.edu/cs/academics/computer-science/faculty/) at the [University of Rhode Island](https://www.uri.edu/). My research is in the areas of adversarial machine learning, the security of machine learning systems and large language models. In the past, I have also published work on hardware security, IoT security and underwater localization. A full list of my publications and citations can be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=axn5PtMAAAAJ).
